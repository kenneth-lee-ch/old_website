      <title>Impact of Interventions seen through mobility</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on assumptions, we have found that state-wide government interventions tend to have a larger effect in reducing mobility in the areas with a large population, a small percentage of people in poverty, a high percent of people with education backgrounds, and a low unemployment rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, recommended polcies, gathering restriction and school closure, may not have a sigificant effect in reducing mobility, whereas some mandatory policies such as public masks and business closures have a significant effect on mobility in California counties. We rank the effectiveness of the intervention on mobility in terms of the regression coefficient in a linear regression setting. Other regression methods should also be used for further study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future, we need to collect more data about county-level intervention to measure the start dates and end dates of the policies more accurately. Also, we can examine other mobility signals available in the Dephi API.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We explore the potential of creating new recipes via text data. Our goal has two folds. First, we aim to classify the cuisine based on ingredients. Second, we want to predict an ingredient that is missing from a given list of ingredients and a cuisine name. The first task can be formulated as a multi-class classification problem. To convert the text into numerical signals, we can use TFIDF vectorizer, Countvectorizer, word embedding based on Word2Vec model. We are able to achieve 0.85 micro-averaged F1 scores for the multi-classification task with multilayer perceptrons and bag-of-words model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first task, we compare several well-known classification algorithms such as logistic regression, naive bayes, linear discriminant analysis, decision tree classifier, random forest, Adaboost, multi-layer perceptrons. We conduct grid search with 5-fold stratified cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second task, we adopt two approaches to process the recipe text, which is the key to the recommender system. We first explore the recommended ingredients based on similarity to the given recipe using vectorizers; and then we examine the performance, in terms of the &amp;ldquo;top n accuracy&amp;rdquo; metric, of a baseline popularity model and a sophiticated collaborative filtering model under the ``text_preprocess method.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Citibike System Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/citibike/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Citibike is New York City’s bike share system established in 2013. It has become a vital part of the transportation network in New York City. It is available for use throughout the entire year. All the riders have access to thousands of bikes at hundreds of stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. In this work, we would like to explore the characteristics of this bike share system and come up with recommendations that may improve the current program based on data analysis wtih the Citi Bike system 2019 data that is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a New York magazine, Intelligencer (&lt;a href=&#34;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2014/03/citi-bikes-four-huge-problems.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2014/03/citi-bikes-four-huge-problems.html&lt;/a&gt;), there are some problems the citi-bike share system faced in 2014. We summarize them as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we increase the number of customer (one-time user)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we have any suggestion to attract more users, especially customer, during Winter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riders complained as bikes went missing for maintenance or protection, leaving certain stations empty for days at a time, what can we do with that problem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we would like to explore the characteristics of this bike share system and try to come up with recommendations to provide potential solutions for the questions above based on data analysis wtih the Citi Bike system 2019 data that is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio</title>
      <link>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/star/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The effects of class sizes on student achievement is an important topic for policymakers in the American K-12 education system. To study the effects of class size on student achievement in the primary grades, the State Department of Education in Tennessee launched a four-year longitudinal class-size randomized study from 1985 to 1989 called The Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR). Over 7000 students in 79 schools participated in this project. We highlight the features of the experiment process in the study below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participating schools had to agree to the random assignment of teachers and students to different class conditions: small class (13 to 17 students per teacher), regular class (22 to 25 students per teacher), and regular-with-aide class (22 to 25 students with a full-time teacher’s aide).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assignments of various class types were initiated as the students entered school in kindergarten and continued through third grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each school must provide enough kindergarten students to be assigned to three numerous class types in order to participate in the project STAR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The student achievement is measured annually via Stanford Achievement Tests (SATs) during the spring term on testing dates specified by the Tennessee state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students moving from a school involved in STAR to another participating school were assigned to the same type of class as they had participated in previously. Also, it is possible that the size of a regular class can be as small as the small class type as students move out of the participating schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides class size and teacher aides, there were no other experimental changes involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were three schools resigned from the project STAR at the end of kindergarten, so that there were only left with 76 schools in the 1st-grade level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our primary scientific question of interest is whether there is a treatment effect of assigning various class types to the average math scaled scores in a 1st-grade class level. We implement exploratory data analysis, two-way ANOVA model, model diagnostics, hypothesis testing. In the end, we will discuss any causal statements that could possibly be made based on our analysis and assumptions and the differences between a student-level and a class-level analysis on this STAR dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work shows that the treatment effect of the class type does exist in a class level for this dataset. We also show that it is possible to make causal statements based on our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Credit Card Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/creditfraud/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/creditfraud/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Credit card fraud detection is one of the most important issues for credit card companies to deal with in order to earn trust from its customers. As machine learning techniques are robust to many tackle classification problems settings such as image recognition, we aim to explore various machine learning classification algorithms on this particular problem of classifying credit card fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work showcases on how to compare different algorithms and fine-tune them. The dataset mainly contains 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. It has 28 principle components, transaction time, and tranaction amount with labels, 0 being non-fraud and 1 being fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Abalone&#39;s Age Prediction</title>
      <link>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/abalone/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/abalone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we aim to resolve the traditionally tedious and time consuming task of determining the age of abalone by constructing predictive models of the ages of abalones using other physical measures that are easier to obtain. Based on the dataset with which we are provided, we construct models of various complexities and propose the one with the highest out-of-sample prediction performance. Our model is able to control the mean squared prediction error to an infinitesimal extent, while subject to only a reasonably small model bias. In addition, we also explore the possibilities of conjecturing other interior content (in-shell information), such as shucked weights of abalone, using measurements which can be obtained prior to cracking the shell (out-of-shell information). Our results show that not only is predicting such in-shell measures with out-of-shell information feasible, but one might achieve even better results than making predictions on the ages of the abalones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heart Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/heart/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/heart/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we aim to train a classifier to accurately classify a person whether or not has a heart disease problem. In particular, we would like to compare several classification algorithms: logistic regression, random forests, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbours based on sensitivity and classification accuracy. Also, it will be beneficial to see if we can reduce the number of features to perform a good classification that may potentially lower the costs of collecting expensive features in the future. Most people believe that age should be a strong indicator whether a person has a heart disease problem. Our project will also validate this claim and see if there are any better indicators with hypothesis testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions-of-interests&#34;&gt;Questions of interests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the relationship between age and heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will combining several predictors into one new predictor variable be useful to improve our model?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will be the best combination of features we should use based on the classification algorithm?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we reduce the number of features and still get a satisfactory classification performance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the best classification rate that we can come up with to predict the presence of heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-exploration&#34;&gt;Data Exploration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first explore the data by making use of boxplots, histograms, density plots, and a scatterplot matrix. In particular, we use boxplots to explore the distribution of some quantitative variables such as maximum heart rate achieved, serum cholesterol, age, resting blood pressure and by gender and disease to see if there is any significant differences among different genders and types of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we would split the data set into training and testing datasets by having 80 percent of the data to be training and 20 percent of the data to be testing. We then implemented several algorithms including logistic regression, random forests, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbors to classify the presence and absence of heart disease. We also conduct outlier detection to see if there is a performance gain by dropping some potential outliers in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;classification-model&#34;&gt;Classification Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;logistic-regression&#34;&gt;Logistic Regression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first compare two logistic models that use all the predictor variables: model 1 and model 2. The difference between these two models is that we dropped two potential outliers (row 259 and 4) by looking at the standardized deviance residual plot and use the rest of the data to train the model 2 to see if there is a performance gain in comparison with model 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we also train three logistic regression models with different numbers of predictors. Model 3 utilizes all first order term and two-way interaction term. Model 4 is only trained with quantitative predictor variables including age, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, maximum heart rate achieved, oldpeak, and major vessels. Model 5 will be trained by a reduced number of features based on our feature selection method. Then, we will select the model with the highest accuracy and sensitivity rate to compare with other algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;probability-threshold-selction-for-logistic-regression-classification&#34;&gt;Probability threshold selction for logistic regression classification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, we use Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve to see what are some best cut-off threshold for getting the most accurate classification rate for each model by picking thresholds that maximizes the area under the curve as it measures how good our model is able to distinguish two classes of the response variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;features-selection&#34;&gt;Features selection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to estimate the variable importance to see if we can reduce the number of features and still achieve a satisfactory result. The importance can be estimated using a ROC curve analysis conducted for each attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evaluation-metric&#34;&gt;Evaluation Metric&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our evaluation metric is based on sensitivity and the accuracy rate. Since it is more important to
correctly identify people who have a heart disease, we set the presence of heart disease as positive. Sensitivity is the true positive rate, which is the percentage of people with heart disease who are correctly identified as having the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we see people who have heart disease are mostly around the age of 60. Also, the predictor variable, age, doesn’t explain the response variable of heart disease as good as the number of major vessels in our logistic regression model. Moreover, we see that combining features into one predictor variable by using two-way interaction terms does not necessarily improve classification performance in general. When we look at our logistic regression models, we see that reducing number of features for training can improve model performance by excluding the predictor named fasting blood sugar. We have found that the following predictors are particularly important in logistic regression model for classification: major vessels, chest pain type, thal, sex, resting blood pressure, slope, oldpeak, serum cholestoral, exercise induced angina and maximum heart rate achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-source&#34;&gt;Data Source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(heart)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UCI heart disease data set&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spam, a bulk of unsolicited messages sent by anonymous sources, has been a costly issue to human communication. Machine learning techniques have been shown promising to filter these messages as it adapts to the evolving characteristics of the spam. In this work, we focus on neural networks to the problem of spam filtering. Overall, we conclude that using bidirectioncomparing various classification methodsal gated recurrent neural network with tokenizer method is the most robust way we have found to handle this problem with our particular dataset. This work provides insights on how to design a neural network to work with spam filtering problem as part of my contribution to a course project titled &amp;ldquo;Machine_Learning_Approaches_to_Spam_Filtering_Problems&amp;rdquo;.

      <title>Meet Don, the Autonomous Dice Rolling Machine</title>
      <link>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/dicemachine/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/dicemachine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We estimated probabilities for tetrahedral and triangular dice using the sphere projection method and multivariate calculus. To test our results, we printed several dice of varying sizes. After a few thousand initial rolls, we realized that our calculations weren’t accurately describing the situation and that bias could have been introduced due to rolling the dice by hand. Therefore, we built a machine to roll the dice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predict Patient Inflow at Pali Momi Hospital’s Emergency Room</title>
      <link>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/pali_momi_hospital/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/pali_momi_hospital/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We use R and Jupyter Notebook in making predictions models to understand patient influx and predict their arrival times. Using these predictions, we can aid Pali Momi hospital in understanding what factors cause over and understaffing. Therefore, we can more positively help Pali Momi hospital to meet patient demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance the given data from the hospital and provide more accurate predictions, we add the following features and variables: 1. Number of walk-ins 2. Airplane passenger arrival counts from the past two years from international and domestic individuals 3. Month of year, week of year 4. Scheduling periods 5. Doctor-to-patient ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we use repeated cross-validation with 10 folds and 3 repeats, a common standard configuration for comparing models by estimating the model accuracy.  Repeated K-fold Cross-Validation method involves splitting the dataset into k-subsets. Each subset is held-out while the model is trained on all other subsets. This process is repeated until accuracy is determined for each instance in the dataset, and an overall accuracy estimate is provided.&lt;/p&gt;
