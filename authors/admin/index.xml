      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kenneth completed a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Statistics at UC Davis and his bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Brigham Young University-Hawaii. Currently, he is pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. His research interests lie in causal inference, machine learning, especially on reinforcement learning and deep learning, robotics, and grahpical models. He believes that artificial general intelligence comes when machines can learn and reason with complex networks of causal relationships perceived by various senses in accomplishing their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his spare time, he likes reading books, cooking, hiking, and traveling. Above all, he loves learning new things. His most favorite quote is: &amp;ldquo;the best lessons in life are often not taught, but caught.&amp;rdquo; by David A. Bednar.&lt;/p&gt;
