Using these predictions, we can aid Pali Momi hospital in understanding what factors cause over and understaffing. Therefore, we can more positively help Pali Momi hospital to meet patient demand.\nTo enhance the given data from the hospital and provide more accurate predictions, we add the following features and variables: 1. Number of walk-ins 2. Airplane passenger arrival counts from the past two years from international and domestic individuals 3. Month of year, week of year 4. Scheduling periods 5. Doctor-to-patient ratio.\nIn this work, we use repeated cross-validation with 10 folds and 3 repeats, a common standard configuration for comparing models by estimating the model accuracy. Repeated K-fold Cross-Validation method involves splitting the dataset into k-subsets. Each subset is held-out while the model is trained on all other subsets. This process is repeated until accuracy is determined for each instance in the dataset, and an overall accuracy estimate is provided.\n","date":1524787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524787200,"objectID":"faf39fd7dea2a065908cb213cb9ca82c","permalink":"https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/pali_momi_hospital/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pali_momi_hospital/","section":"project","summary":"This project predicts the patient inflow at Pali Momi Hospital's Emergency Room (ER) and provides recommendations for how to optimize scheduling for their ER's doctors and mid-level providers.","tags":["Machine Learning","Regression","Data Science"],"title":"Predict Patient Inflow at Pali Momi Hospital’s Emergency Room","type":"project"},{"authors":["Vasu Chetty","Nathan Woodbury","Jacob Brewer","Kenneth Lee","Sean Warnick"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"1d6ac0af192b05c5041ca48bbc4294e9","permalink":"https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/publication/conference-paper/apply-nr-to-twitter/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/apply-nr-to-twitter/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work we apply a systems-theoretic approach to identifying trend setters on Twitter.","tags":["Network Reconstruction","Social Network","System Theory","Causality"],"title":"Applying a Passive Network Reconstruction Technique to Twitter Data in Order to Identify Trend Setters","type":"publication"}]
