This session outlines how a small Institutional Research (IR) office utilized a student research team to condense and improve the Graduating Student Survey (GSS) at BYU-Hawaii.  Their charge was to refocus on the university’s mission (and contribution to the public good) and make the survey results more meaningful and accessible to campus stakeholders. Results from factor analysis, a review of literature and existing similar surveys, and information gleaned from faculty and staff members informed the survey revision pilot.   Results of the pilot, feedback from data consumers, the new version of the survey, and next steps will be shared.  Session participants will be able to discuss the methodology used in this case with presenters, and understand how student researchers can help expand the capacity of a small IR office.","tags":["factor analysis","statistics","institutional research","survey design"],"title":"Graduating Student Survey Revision: A student effort","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kathy Pulotu","Kenneth Lee","Trysta Vallabh","Hong Ni Mui","Rosalind Ram"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533901497,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533901497,"objectID":"f5d23b36f2324bca79db9f281a7f30be","permalink":"https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/publication/gssfirst/","publishdate":"2018-08-10T01:44:57-10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gssfirst/","section":"publication","summary":"This poster outlines steps our student research team at BYU-Hawaii took to answer this question.

Using these predictions, we can aid Pali Momi hospital in understanding what factors cause over and understaffing. Therefore, we can more positively help Pali Momi hospital to meet patient demand.\nTo enhance the given data from the hospital and provide more accurate predictions, we add the following features and variables: 1. Number of walk-ins 2. Airplane passenger arrival counts from the past two years from international and domestic individuals 3. Month of year, week of year 4. Scheduling periods 5. Doctor-to-patient ratio.\nIn this work, we use repeated cross-validation with 10 folds and 3 repeats, a common standard configuration for comparing models by estimating the model accuracy. Repeated K-fold Cross-Validation method involves splitting the dataset into k-subsets. Each subset is held-out while the model is trained on all other subsets. This process is repeated until accuracy is determined for each instance in the dataset, and an overall accuracy estimate is provided.\n","date":1533898192,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533898192,"objectID":"e4144f86bbdd3a53531f29266c09e1e9","permalink":"https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/palimomihospital/","publishdate":"2018-08-10T00:49:52-10:00","relpermalink":"/project/palimomihospital/","section":"project","summary":"This project predicts the patient inflow at Pali Momi Hospital's Emergency Room (ER) and provides recommendations for how to optimize scheduling for their ER's doctors and mid-level providers.","tags":["data-analysis","prediction"],"title":"Predict Patient Inflow at Pali Momi Hospital’s Emergency Room","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533896748,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533896748,"objectID":"35c107210524be1aa3960b3f4ec344b5","permalink":"https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/dicemachine/","publishdate":"2018-08-10T00:25:48-10:00","relpermalink":"/project/dicemachine/","section":"project","summary":"We estimated probabilities for tetrahedral and triangular dice using the sphere projection method and multivariate calculus.

A network reconstruction algorithm was applied to Twitter data to determine causal relationships among topics discussed by popular Twitter users. Causal relationships in this context means that the topics tweeted by a single user influences the topics tweeted by another user, regardless of sentiment. A user that causally influences other users, without themselves being strongly influenced is identified as a trendsetter. This work seeks to identify potential trendsetters among popular Twitter users and demonstrating that causal influence does not always directly correlate with a user's popularity in terms of followers-demonstrating that popularity alone may not be sufficient for identifying trendsetters on Twitter.","tags":["network reconstruction","social network","system theory"],"title":"Applying a Passive Network Reconstruction Technique to Twitter Data in Order to Identify Trend Setters","type":"publication"}]
