      <description>&lt;p&gt;We estimated probabilities for tetrahedral and triangular dice using the sphere projection method and multivariate calculus. To test our results, we printed several dice of varying sizes. After a few thousand initial rolls, we realized that our calculations werenâ€™t accurately describing the situation and that bias could have been introduced due to rolling the dice by hand. Therefore, we built a machine to roll the dice.&lt;/p&gt;
