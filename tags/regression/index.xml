      <title>Abalone&#39;s Age Prediction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we aim to resolve the traditionally tedious and time consuming task of determining the age of abalone by constructing predictive models of the ages of abalones using other physical measures that are easier to obtain. Based on the dataset with which we are provided, we construct models of various complexities and propose the one with the highest out-of-sample prediction performance. Our model is able to control the mean squared prediction error to an infinitesimal extent, while subject to only a reasonably small model bias. In addition, we also explore the possibilities of conjecturing other interior content (in-shell information), such as shucked weights of abalone, using measurements which can be obtained prior to cracking the shell (out-of-shell information). Our results show that not only is predicting such in-shell measures with out-of-shell information feasible, but one might achieve even better results than making predictions on the ages of the abalones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predict Patient Inflow at Pali Momi Hospitalâ€™s Emergency Room</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We use R and Jupyter Notebook in making predictions models to understand patient influx and predict their arrival times. Using these predictions, we can aid Pali Momi hospital in understanding what factors cause over and understaffing. Therefore, we can more positively help Pali Momi hospital to meet patient demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance the given data from the hospital and provide more accurate predictions, we add the following features and variables: 1. Number of walk-ins 2. Airplane passenger arrival counts from the past two years from international and domestic individuals 3. Month of year, week of year 4. Scheduling periods 5. Doctor-to-patient ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we use repeated cross-validation with 10 folds and 3 repeats, a common standard configuration for comparing models by estimating the model accuracy.  Repeated K-fold Cross-Validation method involves splitting the dataset into k-subsets. Each subset is held-out while the model is trained on all other subsets. This process is repeated until accuracy is determined for each instance in the dataset, and an overall accuracy estimate is provided.&lt;/p&gt;
