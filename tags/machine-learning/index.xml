      <title>Citibike System Data Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Citibike is New York City’s bike share system established in 2013. It has become a vital part of the transportation network in New York City. It is available for use throughout the entire year. All the riders have access to thousands of bikes at hundreds of stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. In this work, we would like to explore the characteristics of this bike share system and come up with recommendations that may improve the current program based on data analysis wtih the Citi Bike system 2019 data that is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a New York magazine, Intelligencer (&lt;a href=&#34;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2014/03/citi-bikes-four-huge-problems.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2014/03/citi-bikes-four-huge-problems.html&lt;/a&gt;), there are some problems the citi-bike share system faced in 2014. We summarize them as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we increase the number of customer (one-time user)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we have any suggestion to attract more users, especially customer, during Winter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riders complained as bikes went missing for maintenance or protection, leaving certain stations empty for days at a time, what can we do with that problem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we would like to explore the characteristics of this bike share system and try to come up with recommendations to provide potential solutions for the questions above based on data analysis wtih the Citi Bike system 2019 data that is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Credit card fraud detection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Credit card fraud detection is one of the most important issues for credit card companies to deal with in order to earn trust from its customers. As machine learning techniques are robust to many tackle classification problems settings such as image recognition, we aim to explore various machine learning classification algorithms on this particular problem of classifying credit card fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work showcases on how to compare different algorithms and fine-tune them. The dataset mainly contains 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. It has 28 principle components, transaction time, and tranaction amount with labels, 0 being non-fraud and 1 being fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SMS Spam Classification</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spam, a bulk of unsolicited messages sent by anonymous sources, has been a costly issue to human communication. Machine learning techniques have been shown promising to filter these messages as it adapts to the evolving characteristics of the spam. In this work, we focus on neural networks to the problem of spam filtering. Overall, we conclude that using bidirectioncomparing various classification methodsal gated recurrent neural network with tokenizer method is the most robust way we have found to handle this problem with our particular dataset. This work provides insights on how to design a neural network to work with spam filtering problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meet Don, the Autonomous Dice Rolling Machine</title>
      <link>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/dicemachine/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We estimated probabilities for tetrahedral and triangular dice using the sphere projection method and multivariate calculus. To test our results, we printed several dice of varying sizes. After a few thousand initial rolls, we realized that our calculations weren’t accurately describing the situation and that bias could have been introduced due to rolling the dice by hand. Therefore, we built a machine to roll the dice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predict Patient Inflow at Pali Momi Hospital’s Emergency Room</title>
      <link>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/pali_momi_hospital/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kenneth-lee-ch.github.io/project/pali_momi_hospital/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We use R and Jupyter Notebook in making predictions models to understand patient influx and predict their arrival times. Using these predictions, we can aid Pali Momi hospital in understanding what factors cause over and understaffing. Therefore, we can more positively help Pali Momi hospital to meet patient demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance the given data from the hospital and provide more accurate predictions, we add the following features and variables: 1. Number of walk-ins 2. Airplane passenger arrival counts from the past two years from international and domestic individuals 3. Month of year, week of year 4. Scheduling periods 5. Doctor-to-patient ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we use repeated cross-validation with 10 folds and 3 repeats, a common standard configuration for comparing models by estimating the model accuracy.  Repeated K-fold Cross-Validation method involves splitting the dataset into k-subsets. Each subset is held-out while the model is trained on all other subsets. This process is repeated until accuracy is determined for each instance in the dataset, and an overall accuracy estimate is provided.&lt;/p&gt;
